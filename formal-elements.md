## רכיבים רשמיים

### 1. שחקנים

* The game is suited for players age 14+, As some riddles may prove difficult for younger children to solve. It also requires no previous skills, using your head is all it takes to eventually solve every riddle. No technical skill or dexteriry is needed.
It's suited mainly for players who like riddles and puzzles.
* The game is suited to 1-3 players
* The interaction between players is cooperative, you work together to escape

### 2. יעדים

* The objective of the game is to escape the lab, you do so by solving every riddle
* The game will alert the player by providing on-screen messages as the first level loads, to introduce players to the concept of locks and riddles, and also point out the main objective
* There aren't any side-objectives to complete, as the game is linear in it's progression system.

### 3. תהליכים

תארו בפירוט את:

* The first moments of the game will have the player break a very simple, obvious riddle using a clue which will be highlighted, This will give the player the understanding of the main gameplay feature (Solving riddles using clues), and give them the satisfaction of opening a lock(=solving a riddle) early on.
* The core game loop consists of 2 main stages. Looking for clues -> Trying to unlock /solve the riddle. This will lead a player to the next room or riddle, where the process will repeat
* The game ends once the player solves the final riddle, this is mainly achieved by solving each previous riddle, as each riddle solved will grant access to a clue for the following riddle. Technically, unless a system is placed to prevent it, players can guess their way through the game, but it is very unlikely. (For example a 4 digit password consisting of number 0-9 will be hard to guess right)

The gameplay mechanics and rules are VERY simple. The trick doesn't lie in understanding the rules, as the first few seconds of the game intorduce you to the only rule there is (Correct input will open the lock). The trick is to understand the logic behind each riddle.

It is desired that the player will be confused about the next step throughout the entire game, because otherwise, the game will be too easy.

Look at real-life escape rooms, none are simple to solve, and usually players have a hard time understanding what to do next. It's a part of the game

Players will use the keyboard to move around, the the mouse to interact with objects.


### 4. חוקים

* As discussed before - the only rule of the game is that you need to input the correct combination to unlock a lock(=solve a riddle)
* The first intro level will show the player that entering a wrong cominbation will do nothing, while entering a correct one will unlock the lock.

Like mentioned above, the rules are simple and will be understood immediatly. The hard part is figuring out the SOLUTION to the riddles, not the RULES of the game


### 5. משאבים

* The resources are clues, as they are the only thing needed to progress in the game.
* Clues will be laid out or hidden around the map. Each clue will lead the player closer to unlocking a relavent lock. Once a lock opens, more clues will become available
* The game-loop itself makes clues rare, as you cannot acquire more clues without first using previous clues to unlock the current lock, which will in turn allow more clues to be discovered.
* The player will not know how many clues he has left to collect, or how many more are needed to solve the current riddle. It adds to the mystery of the game

### 6. עימותים

מה יהיו העימותים המרכזיים במשחק:

* The only real confilct in the game is between the player and system.
The systems in the game are blocking the player from progressing if he didn't unlock what was required.


### 7. גבולות


* The map is closed - not open world. The only playable area is the room the player has unlocked, or previousy unlocked.

* The game will let the player know the boundries by not allowing the player to progress further: A door with a lock on it inside a room with no other visible exists is the game's way to show the player that to progress beyond this room he has to unlock the door.
* In addition, The player is located inside a closed building, meaning the game very clearly streamlines the progression of the player, it is impossible to mistake the boundries, and where a must go to continue. 

For example: After opneing a door and finidng himself in a room with 2 doors, A player might think that he has 2 options to continue. He finds a clue clearly linked to the left door, and a clue linked to the right.

after searching and seeing that no other clues remain, he understands he only has enough information to open the left door. 

Upon opening it, he finds himself in a room, with no other doors, and a clue the right-door previously mentioned.
It is now clear that the player has to return to the previous room and unlock the right door.

### 8. תוצאות

* The game will have only 2 possible outcomes. Success - Solve all the riddles. Faliure - Fail to solve even a single one
* The game will be cooperative

The following is true for all games: The concept of each of these games is simillar to our game, Although several key differences remain, which can altar the player experience and make our game stand out.

First of all, From what I gathered, Each of these games focuses on a single room at a time, not an entire complex of rooms, relating to one another.

In addition, in games 2 and 3, You cannot move freely around the map.

What makes our game extra special though, is the story, As you progress through the game, you find out the truth about yourself, and where you are trapped, this adds mystery and a big laugh once the game ends

SPOILER ALERT:

As you progress you understand early on you are trapped in a lab in China.

During the end of the game, you will be in a room with a mirror, allowing the player to view themselves. Then, they will see they look like the Covid-19 virus, and they have escaped to the outside world!
